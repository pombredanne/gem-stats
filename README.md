# gem-stats

View gemcutter stastics for any given gem.

There's more planned, but I've got to wait for the Gemcutter API to come along. I hope to be able to show all versions and dependencies when available.

## Installation

If you already have gemcutter as a source, it's as easy as:

    sudo gem install gem-stats

Otherwise, you'll need to install by source

    sudo gem install gem-stats --source http://gemcutter.org
